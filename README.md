## How to use the collection

To get started, follow these three steps:

1. _In Postman:_ [Fork the collection itself](#step-1-fork-the-tableau-rest-api-collection).
2. _In Postman:_ [Fork the environment variables for the collection](#step-2-fork-the-environment-variables-for-the-collection).
3. _In your fork_: [Declare values for variables](#step-3-declare-values-for-variables).

Once you have completed these steps you are ready to send requests to your Tableau environment!

</br>

### **Step 1: Fork the Tableau REST API collection**

1. Go to the Tableau REST API collection in the [Salesforce Developer's Postman workspace](https://www.postman.com/salesforce-developers/workspace/salesforce-developers/collection/12721794-7d783742-165f-4d10-8c4c-5719fb60fba2?ctx=documentation) in a browser.
2. Sign in to or create a free Postman account.  
3. Choose the three dots next to **Tableau REST API** to view more actions.
![create a fork](assets/images/create_a_fork.png)
4. Choose **Create a fork**.
5. Name the fork and the Postman workspace you want it to live in.
   ![fork collection](assets//images/fork_collection.png)
6.  Keep the **Watch original collection** checkbox selected to be alerted whenever updates are available to the collection.
7. Choose **Fork collection**. 
   
   > At this point you should see the collection in your Postman workspace.

</br>

### **Step 2: Fork the environment variables for the collection**

1. Go to the [**Environments**  section of the the Salesforce Postman workspace ](https://www.postman.com/salesforce-developers/workspace/salesforce-developers/collection/12721794-67cb9baa-e0da-4986-957e-88d8734647e2) .
1. Choose the three dots next to **Tableau REST API Environment** to view more actions.
3. Choose **Create a fork**.
4. Name the fork. 
1. Make sure to use the same Postman workspace you used for the collection.  
6. Choose **Fork environment**.

   > Now you should see the **Tableau REST API Environment** environment variables in your Postman workspace.

7. (Optional) Choose the three dots next to the forked environment and rename it to differentiate it from the original.

   > This way, if you want to set up multiple environments for different Tableau servers or sites, you can duplicate the original environment variables and customize credentials and other values per environment.
   
<br/>

### **Step 3: Declare values for variables**

To configure the collection for your Tableau environment: 

1. Go to the **Environment Variable** section of Postman and open the **Tableau REST API Environment** file.

    > ***NOTE:*** You can duplicate your fork to declare environment variables for different Tableau sites and servers. That way each set of environment variables can be saved for later use. 

   ![environment variables](assets/images/environment_variables.png)

1. For the `server` variable value, enter the domain of your Tableau service into the `CURRENT VALUE` field. For instance: 

   ```
   myserver.example.com
   ```
    or 
   
   ```
   10ay.online.tableau.com
   ```

2. Determine the authentication method you wish to use and declare the `CURRENT VALUE` for those fields in the environment file. To understand how credentials impact the responses to obtain from Tableau's REST API, see [Tableau authentication credentials and permissions](#tableau-authentication-credentials-and-permissions).

1. Modify `content-url`, the permanent name of a Tableau site. The `content-url` in the following examples is "mySite":

   ```
   http://myServer.com/#/site/mySite/

   https://10ay.online.tableau.com/#/site/mySite
   ```

2. Set `api-version` to match the version of the REST API that you wish to use ([see REST API versioning](https://help.tableau.com/current/api/rest_api/en-us/REST/rest_api_concepts_versions.htm#rest_api_versioning)).

3. Save your changes.

4. Modify the Environment in the top right corner to your environment variables.

4. Authenticate by running a sign in request and BOOM!, you are ready to use the collection.

   See [Automatic Authentication](#automatic-authentication) to skip manual sign in.

#### **Update your forks**

  To update your collection forks, select the three dots next to the collection name, and then select **Pull changes**.

  ![pull changes in postman](assets/images/pull_changes.png)

</br>

#### **Tableau authentication credentials and permissions** 

Tableau credentials are mapped to individual users which enforce access controls and permissions defined in your Tableau environment. This means that certain methods are only available to admin users and API responses will only contain data that the given user has access to. 

A detailed description of authentication methods can be found in the [Authentication section of the API Reference](https://help.tableau.com/current/api/rest_api/en-us/REST/rest_api_ref_authentication.htm#sign_in). Authentication methods include Username & Password, [Personal Access Token](https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en-us/security_personal_access_tokens.htm) (PAT), and JWT (Connected Apps).

To understand how credentials are kept safe within Postman, refer to the documentation on [initial and current variables](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/managing-environments/#adding-environment-variables) as well as [variable types](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/#variable-types).

You can use credentials for an admin user to get broad access to API methods and the resources they touch. That kind of access is reduced for Users with lesser permissions. To test granted permissions or troubleshoot a user's problem, an admin can  [impersonate other users](https://help.tableau.com/current/api/rest_api/en-us/REST/rest_api_ref_authentication.htm#sign_in) when needed.

This table shows the types of authentication supported in REST API requests.

| CREDENTIAL                  | VARIABLES (_Administrator , Impersonated User_)             |
| -----------                 | -----------            |
| Username & Password         | `admin-username` , `user-username`       |
|                             | `admin-password` , `user-password`    |
| Personal Access Token (PAT) | `admin-PAT-name` , `user-PAT-name`      |
|                             | `admin-PAT-secret` , `user-PAT-secret`    |
| Connected Apps (JWT)        | `JWT` (_scoped access via app code_)                 |

</br>

#### **Automatic Authentication** 

  To authenticate yourself in Tableau manually, you can choose and use one of the authentication methods that matches the credential type(s) that you have configured in your environment variables. You can also configure the collection to skip manual authentication and automatically authenticate when you make a request.

  To turn on auto authentication, choose the **Tableau REST API Collection** in Postman at the top level, and then choose the **Variables** tab, and set the current value of `auto-auth` to `true`.

  ![automatic authentication](assets/images/auto_auth.png)

  >***NOTE:*** If more than one type of credentials are configured in your environment variables, the type used by automatic authientication is not predictable. For instance, if valid credentials for both an administrator and a user to be impersonated are configured, the user that gets validated last will be the one signed in. Likewise, if PAT and username/password credentails are configured, the type of configuration used to sign in can't be predicted. If you need to control the sign in method, we recommend using manual sign in, or only configuring a single set of credentials in your environment variables.
  
</br>

#### **Set environment variables from response values**

Postman allows you to right-click on the returned value in a request's response body and assign that value to an environment value.  This is helpful because a common action is to make an initial request in order to obtain the ID or name of a resource (workbook, user, datasource, etc.) in order to use that value in a subsequent request to the REST API. 
  
This collection supplies a comprehensive list of variables for each Tableau resource type. Those variables are also formatted in the URI paths for each request. This means that using an ID or name from a response in the next request is quick, easy, and much less bug prone than copy pasting said values.

![set environment variables from response values](assets/images/assign_id_to_variable.png)

</br>

#### **Credentials token, `site-id`, and `auto-auth`**

In order to use Tableau's REST API effectively, it is very important to understand how authentication works as responses from the API will differ based on the user credentials used to establish a session to send requests. The 'Concepts' section of Tableau's API reference states the following [Signing In and Signing Out (Authentication)](https://help.tableau.com/current/api/rest_api/en-us/REST/rest_api_concepts_auth.htm):

>_The Tableau Server REST API requires that you send a credentials token with each request. The credentials token lets the server verify you as a valid, signed in user. To get a token, you call Sign In and pass credentials of a valid user, either a Personal Access Token (PAT), a user name and password, along with the content URL (subpath) of the site you are signing in to. A [subset of Tableau REST methods](https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en-us/connected_apps_scopes.htm#scopes-available-for-the-tableau-rest-api-tableau-online-only) support sign in using a JSON Web Token (JWT), typically generated by a Tableau [connected app](https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en-us/connected_apps.htm)._

In other words, your first request should aim to establish a new session using a set of credentials. Subsequent requests to Tableau require an `X-Tableau-Auth` header containing the API key or token as it's value. The API key is obtain as a successful response to a sign in method.

This Postman collection will automatically use new API keys (by storing them as the `api-key` variable) each time a response is received from the API containing a new session. This means that you should never need to worry about setting the `X-Tableau-Auth` header yourself since manual requests to a "Sign In" method or automatic authentication via `auto-auth` will already do this for you.

For security purposes the API key or session will expire and needs to be refreshed for continued use. When `auto-auth` is `true`, a script that performs the sign in flow runs before each request, ensuring that the token value is always valid. When `auto-auth` is `false`, you will need to manually sign in to refresh the `token value`.
